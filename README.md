Bookshelf Authorization [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valet-io/bookshelf-authorization.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valet-io/bookshelf-authorization) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/bookshelf-authorization.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/bookshelf-authorization)
=======================

An authorization library for use with Bookshelf.js with an easy-to-read syntax and powerful promise-based authorization rules. 

This is pre-release software. So while it's well-tested, there are almost certainly some remaining bugs. I'm slowly rolling this out to all my projects and should hit 0.1 (usable release) soon. Use at your own risk, and file issues if you catch anything.
